(X(Twitter) is recommended because it is easier to send images.)

If reporting a bug, it will be smoother if you submit it following the format below.

:::info

- The creator needs to reproduce the bug in their environment, so please include as many details as possible.
- When reporting a bug, please check if it also occurs with an unmodified avatar (one straight from the prefab).
  - If the bug occurs with an unmodified avatar, there is no need to describe the outfit, tools, etc.
- If you are sending images through Booth, please use a service like [imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) to provide image URLs. On X(Twitter), you can send images directly.
