### Product Description

[Marshmallow PB](https://wataame89.booth.pm/items/4511536) is a soft, “squishy” PhysBone system dedicated to chest movement.  
By computing expansion and contraction and simulating the influence of gravity, it achieves more realistic behavior than normal PhysBones.

With a setup system that uses Modular Avatar and the [Non-Destructive Modular Framework (NDMF)](https://github.com/bdunderscore/ndmf), you can introduce it non-destructively and very easily.  
Even if your avatar is not officially supported, you can still install it by placing the setup object in the scene and adjusting its position.

In addition to standard PhysBones, it combines animations and constraints to achieve its behavior.  
By adding an object and an FX layer to your avatar, it will work out of the box. From ver1.7.0 onward, it supports NDMF, so you can keep your project clean without baking changes into the avatar itself.

In Marshmallow PB ver2.0, the internal system was rebuilt, the configuration items were reorganized, and it now provides an even softer, more marshmallow-like chest feel.

### Features

- **Squish function:** When you press or grab the chest, it squishes and then returns smoothly.
- **Jiggle function:** Rich jiggle expressions with multiple presets, left–right interaction, and both parallel and circular jiggle.
- **Gravity function:** Lying on your back makes the chest spread and squish; bending forward makes it stretch in a natural way.
- **Mutual interaction:** Players who both have Marshmallow PB installed can make their chests interact with each other.
- **Menu controls:** EX menu items let you toggle squish, switch back to normal PB, or disable Marshmallow PB while in VR.
- **Fine-tuning options:** Chest collider settings, turning colliders off while grabbed, floor colliders, and many other detailed parameters.
