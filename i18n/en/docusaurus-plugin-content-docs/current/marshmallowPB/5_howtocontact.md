If your question is not covered in [“How to Use/Advanced”](https://wataame89.github.io/documents-wataameya/marshmallowPB/howtouse/addition), [“If You Run into Trouble”](https://wataame89.github.io/documents-wataameya/marshmallowPB/howtouse/addition), or [“Q&A”](https://wataame89.github.io/documents-wataameya/marshmallowPB/qa), please contact the creator via [Booth](https://wataame89.booth.pm) or [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/wataameya_vr). (X(Twitter) is recommended because it’s easier to send images.)

When reporting a bug, using the format below will make the process smoother:

:::info

- We need to reproduce the bug in the author’s environment, so please provide as many details as possible.
- When reporting a bug, please check whether the same issue occurs on an unmodified avatar (i.e., the prefab avatar with no changes).
  - If the unmodified avatar also shows the same bug, you don’t need to describe outfit or tool details.
- If sending images on Booth, please use an image-sharing service such as [imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) and send the image URL. On X(Twitter), you can attach images directly.
